OpenShark 
=========

 - Check `aweshark` branch for awesomium & wpf based project
 - Run build.bat to build...

FEATURES (Most of features are just WinGrooves but I list them anyways)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Open GrooveShark in a separate window instead of a web browser
 - Minimize to the tray
 - Tray icon buttons [ Next Previous Play / Stop Like Dislike ]
 - Control using the media keys on your keyboard or using global customizable Hotkeys while in any application
 - Twitter or TweetDeck as second tab... (Should be optional in future)

Fix Visual Studio and MetroFramework:

 1. Navigate to Debug->Exceptions.
 2. Expand "Managed Debugging Assistants"
 3. Uncheck the NonComVisibleBaseClass Thrown option.
 4. Click "OK"

TODO:

 - All the properties to xml or ini file (maybe conf for mono)
 - Options window to config all the stuff
